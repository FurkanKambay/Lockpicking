# Lockpicking

Realistic lockpicking mechanic in Unity.

[Here is a preview.](https://i.imgur.com/kuVSn2V.mp4)

## Plans

- The binding pin should provide proper feedback.
- Better 3D models
- Sound
- Option to generate flawed locks (key pin going above the shear line, etc.)
- Obstructing the view of the insides
  - We could get away with showing only the pick and the plug. Hopefully, with proper feedback of binding pins, it will be effective.
  - This should be an option in case the user wants to have x-ray vision.
  - If the visuals are ever not enough, we still have sound.
- Maybe a way to show the tension only visually and not numerically. That way, player has to pay attention to the plug's rotation.
- If possible, spool and serrated driver pins.
